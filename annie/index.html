				<h3>About Annie O'Shea</h3>
				<img class="aboutimg" src="images/anniesmile.jpg">
				<p>Annie O'Shea began in the sport of skeleton in November 2004 and quickly rose in international standings, claiming the 2007 America's Cup title her first year on the national team. O'Shea claimed the final 2007-08 World Cup spot by winning the final National Team Trials race in Park City, Utah on November 10, 2007. O'Shea has a B.S. in sport management and wellness and fitness from California University of Pennsylvania. She is currently pursuing her MBA in international business from Keller Graduate School of Management. </p>
				<p>She was a track athlete in high school high school and the start of her college career when she attended Plattsburgh State University. She was the 2004 N.Y. state champion in the pentathlon, and has always loved sprinting and jumping.</p>
				<p>She was first introduced to the sport of skeleton when she was competing in the summer Empire State Games in N.Y. She was approached by John Daly's father, during the summer of 2004, when O'Shea was going into her senior year of high school. That November, with her parents encouragement, she traveled to Lake Placid for her first ever camp. She wasn't in love at first, but she was invited back in February and decided to give it one more chance before her winter N.Y. state meet and before she made her final college commitments. It wasn't until that trip that she really found a love for the sport. She changed all of her plans and decided to pursue skeleton with the support of her family.</p>
